# 🧠 Multi-Agent AI File Processor

## 📌 Objective

Build a **multi-agent AI system** that accepts files in **PDF**, **JSON**, or **Email (text)** formats, classifies both the **file type** and **intent**, and routes the content to a specialized agent for processing. The system uses a **shared memory module** to maintain context, traceability, and logs across agents.

> This tool helps automate and organize unstructured inputs, making document workflows faster and smarter.

---

## ⚙️ Overview

The system includes three specialized agents:

- 🧩 **Classifier Agent**  
  Detects the file format and intent (e.g., *Invoice*, *RFQ*, *Complaint*) and routes the content accordingly.

- 📬 **Email Agent**  
  Parses sender, subject, urgency, and determines intent from plain-text email files.

- 🧾 **JSON Agent**  
  Processes structured JSON files, checks for required fields, and flags missing ones.

A lightweight **SQLite-based shared memory** module tracks extracted values and logs processing data.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Automatic format detection: PDF, JSON, Email
- ✅ Intent classification (Invoice, RFQ, Complaint, etc.)
- ✅ Specialized agents per file type
- ✅ Shared SQLite memory for logs and context
- ✅ Batch file processing via script
- ✅ Interactive web upload interface (Flask)
- ✅ Structured JSON result output

---

## 🛠 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-ai.git
cd multi-agent-ai
````

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

<details>
<summary>On macOS/Linux</summary>

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>On Windows</summary>

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

</details>

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Program

### 🧾 Batch File Processing

1. Place your test files (PDF, JSON, TXT/EML) inside the `data/` folder.
2. Run the batch processing script:

```bash
python batch_process.py
```

You’ll see the format, intent, and extracted metadata printed to the console.

---

### 🌐 Launch the Web Interface

1. Start the Flask server:

```bash
python web/app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

3. Upload a file and view the parsed results in JSON.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads a file or the system reads from `data/`.
2. `ClassifierAgent` detects the file format and intent.
3. The file is routed to:

   * `JSONAgent` for structured data.
   * `EmailAgent` for unstructured email content.
   * PDF text is extracted using PyMuPDF.
4. Shared memory logs the processing data.
5. The result is returned in structured JSON.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* Flask
* PyMuPDF (`fitz`) for PDF extraction
* SQLite3 (built-in)
* Standard libraries: `os`, `json`, `tempfile`, etc.

## 📝 Notes

* Sample files go in the `data/` folder.
* `shared_memory.db` is auto-created on first run.
* You can extend the system easily by:

  * Adding new file types
  * Implementing more agents
  * Expanding intent classification
